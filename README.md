# PHP AES-256-CBC Encryption/Decryption

This project demonstrates a basic encryption and decryption system using AES-256-CBC in PHP. Users can enter data (like their name and age) to be encrypted or decrypted through a simple web interface. This example is intended as a learning tool to understand the basics of encryption and decryption in PHP.

## Features

- **AES-256-CBC Encryption**: Provides secure encryption using PHP's OpenSSL library.
- **Client-Side Form Validation**: HTML to handle user input

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have:

- **PHP 7.2+** (with OpenSSL extension enabled)
- **A Local Server** like XAMPP or WAMP for PHP testing.
- **Optional** Tunneling with Ngrok.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thisgirlElan/AESDecryption.git

## Usage
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Input a name and age to encrypt or paste encrypted text to decrypt.
3. Click the Encrypt or Decrypt button.
4. If decrypting, the results will populate on the screen.

## Code Structure
- index.html: Contains the HTML form with fields for entering data to encrypt or decrypt.
- style.css: Provides basic styling for the form.
- decryptor.php: Handles encryption and decryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm.
- encryptor.php: Handles encryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm, with an option to enable decryption by calling decryptor.php.

## Technologies Used
- PHP: Backend processing of encryption and decryption.
- HTML & CSS: Frontend layout and design.
